# README

This repo provides links to code which has been developed by LT3 in the framework of the NewsDNA project (https://www.ugent.be/mict/en/research/newsdna)

## EventDNA

During the course of the NewsDNA project, an experimental corpus has been compiled and annotated. This corpus is referred to as the NewsDNA corpus.
For more information about the corpus itself we refer to the paper "EventDNA: a dataset for Dutch news event extraction" (link will be added upon publication).
The experiments reported in the paper can be reproduced by:

#### Downloading the corpus
